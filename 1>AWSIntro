Before Cloud - After Cloud
---------------------------
Before cloud if you want to host a application werequired the below things
1> Servers 2> Network 3> Applicatins 4> People to work
All thee things will take time to complete the infra but after cloud we can do a setup quickly

DATA CENTER: Whre we put all the server along with the network

AWS INFRA:
---------
Data Center --> AZ --> Region(location) --> AWS

Each Region has unique name and all regions are interconnected

Services in AWS:
----------------
1> Compute (Ec2, Lamda)                                                     8> Management & Governance (Moniterning)
2> Data base (Oracle, mango db)                                             9> Security, Identity and complainace 
3> Storage                                                                  10> Analytics

5> Application Migration                                                    12> Robotics                                            
6> Developer Tools (DevOpps)                                                13> Machine Learning
7>Network and content Delivery

Additional to the above services we can have more but these are the importnat


Compute:
>EC@, Elastic bean stalk, Lambda

Database:
>RDS, Dynamo DB, Oracle, Elastice cache

Storage:
S3, EBS(HD), EFS(HardDrive)

Container: 
ECS, EKS(Kubernetes), ECR(Container resource)

Application Servers: SQS, SNS both are mesaging

Developer Tools: 
>Code Commit(GIT), Code Articraft (jfrog or Nexus), Code Build (Jenkins), Code deploy( Spinnakar, Jenkins) , Code pipeline

Network & Content Delivery: 
>VPC(personnal Cloud), Route S3(DNS), Cloud front, LB, API Gateway

Management and Governance : Cloud Watch (Monitering tools), Cloud Form watch(IAAS) used for automation with text file

Securoty and compliance: IAM, Cognito, Certification Manager for certs, WAF (web application firewall)

Analytics: Elastic search, Athena, Kinesis these are for analysing the data
