Virtual private cloud:
---------------------

Private cloud only for you no one can touch that
one default vpc is there created by AWS

VPC is a service and its free

In real time we have different networks
by default one VPC can't communicate with other VPC
we can enable the communication if needed whihc is called vpc peering

it is some type if isolation
Router will help to speak with other VPC
vip routter for vpc to internet

subnet depends on no of AZ's
vpc is a region scope and subnet is AZ scope
there is one internal router by default we can't acess it
vpc is some type of sagrigation

IGW to conecto to the internaet so that we can connect to our machine via putty or ssh

VPC is one network and subnet is one more network

there are two types of subnets:

1> Prvate subnet

2>Public subnet


Private subnet is to keep the secure and critical servers



Rotung table:
-----------
Every subnet asosiated with a routing table it contains the infermation about the entire envirniment 
All the communication happen through routing table only
roting table contain the infermation about route to specific object like internet, db ..etc



VPC -  sb1/sb2 - Route table - IGW - Internet

Security Group:

to protect the EC2 instance with in the subnet
at the ec2 level and can't allow incoming traffic by deafult and all denied applicable by default
Default SG in AWS

VPC can span across the AZ's with the help of subnets



CIDR Block :
----------

defines how many ip's needed in the vpc , we can check it in cidr calculator

/16 - 65k
/24 - 256
/8 - 16 million



TEnancy:  2 options 
1> Default
2>Dedicated

in default server can launch in any of the host and its sharable
in dedicated complete host is given to your instance,, and special charges are there 1 doller for eavery hour



Deviding big network into small networks by using the subnet


Private subnet:
we can't connect to the IGW in routing table
public subnet routing table can't be same as private subnet bcz igw not connected

**note: if same cidr range not allowed with in the VPc
