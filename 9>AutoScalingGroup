Auto Scaling :
This service used for EC2, ECS, 2 db (Aurora and dynamo db)

What is Auto scaling: 
It add more servers if needed and remove servers if not needed its all based on the demand or can called as load

Load means number of requests, cpu, network precentage

How autoscaling works??

scale out/ scale in:
-------------------
Scale out: to match in increase load
Scale in: to a match a decrease in load

Advantages of Autoscaling: by auto scaling output time will increase and cost reduces because of servers decommision after the load decreases



What is Launch configuration Template??
it used to tell what kind of server, whihc ami want to use, we can use own ami to get the instance along with the application, which sg, which LB, which Target group al these 
things attached to this launch template

create launch configuration in auto scaling group and attach it
--------------------------------------------------------------

name:
select AMI: (Mostly customised AMI we wil use)
select Key Pair or create a new key pair:
Network Settings: select the SG
Remaining all are defautlt
Launch template

How do you create autoscaling group???

go to EC2 - auto scaling groups - 
we need launch coonfiguration for this select the template :
where do you want need to create instance: select all AZ's

Create a Load balancer: create a new load balancer
AZ's are by default taken in LB:
slect target group: if not there create new instantly it will create automatically
select min and max instances:
add notifications: create the topic and provide the emain id and selet the scenarios when to trigger the mail
review and create auto scaling


with the above setup we have created the LB and target group and ec2 servers
we would have get the mail at the time auto scaling
we need to confimr the subscriptionin the mail to get the mails


we can add ec2 servers to the auto scaling group
desired state : when no traffic desired to be there

if want to update the auto scaling group we can create the new launch configuration and update it to the existing auto scaling group
we can't alter the existing group in the auto scaling group


When you delee the ASG everything created by the ASG will be terminated and removed


we can add triggers to activiate the ASG

dynamic policies:

asg - automatic scaling -dynamic scaling policy

target tracking scaling:
no of reques: 30 or 40

Here ASG create a new instacnce if there are 50 instance
we can the no of requests are LB level metrics



ASG will uses the monitering cloud wathc in the backend and will get a alarm when target reached, we will get the mail.
we can see the ASG flow log with all the details what is going to be happen by ASG
pooling period is 5 mins that ASG consider before launching the instances
we can change the desired no of servers in the ASG to reduse te servers instanctly


scaling policies:
-----------------

3 different scaling policies

1>Dynamic scaling
2>Predective scaling
3>scedule scaling


Dynamic: based on cpu utilisation , user load , network traffic

Predective scaling policy: if we want every monday 9 we have peak traffic for the app we need full capacity at 9 am 
every friday after 5pm no one can access so we can give min capacity

scheduled: Want to get teh no of instance available at specifc sheduled time




we can edit te dynamic policy


EC2 Launc template:
1> AMI
2>nstance type
3>ec2 user data
4>EBS volumes
5>Security Groups
6>Key pair



ASG contains:
1> Launc configuratin/template
2>Netwrk & subnets
3>LB info
4>Group size (min/max/desired capacity)
5>Scaling policies


desired capacity we can chagnge it based on the load and utilisation


Dynamic scaling polices:
-------------------

1> Target tracking scalling:
Based on specific target value
eg avg cpu or reuest count


2>Simple scaling:
Based on cloud wath alarm
if cpu is 70% add 2 instacen and <30% remove 2 instances,, we can decide here 


3> Step scaling:

Based on cloud wathc alarm but configure compleex rules

eg : add 1 ec2 bwn 70 to 80%
add 2 if cpu is 80 to 90%
