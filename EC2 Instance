Key Points:
AMI/CPU/Memory/Storage

AMI: Image id, This is an unique id for every imge.
By default AWS provide images with ami id we can select them while creating the instance and for cloud formation as well

Types of Instances:
 1> Compute optimised
 2> Meorey Optimised
 3>Storage Optimised
 4> General optimised
 5> GPU Optimised

Storage: for storage we can use ebc, efs, s3

Coonecting to EC2: we can connect in 3 ways like via browser and in putty and in cmd of windows
public ip will be used to connect to the instnace

in cmd of windows: ssh -i <sectret key path> user@public-ip


How to stat and stop instnace: 

Select the instance options: stop, start, reboot ..etc

After every stop and start ip address will change
After every reboot ip won't changed

Terminate: same like stop we have terminate option in the same path

Coonecting with browser : select the instance and click on connect

via putty we need to have prive key use putty gen to convert pem to private key




Instant Types:
1> Compute Optimised: More CPU (c5)

2> Memorey Optimised: R4, X1e (ram/X-term)

3> General Purpose: t1, t2, t2.micro ..,m5 (tinyor turbo) (medium or main)

4> Memorey Optimised:   h1 (hdd)/ i3 (iops)/ d2 (dense)

5> GPU optimised: p3 (pictures)







EC2 Pricing:
___________


1> On-Demand (very high)
2> Reserve (50% Discount)
3> Spot

On-Demand: we can createand access and terminate when ever we want 
Reserve:  at least one year for long term users and db
Spot: AWS will conduct bid for this 90% off but we have to give it back when AWS needs it
