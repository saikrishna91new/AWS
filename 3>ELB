What is the load balancer? 
It balances the load to the backend servers to serve the request
It knows the stats of servers always
wiht LB no need to expose the ip of the server to the internet so it wil increase the securoty
It will distribute the load to backend server equally or with mentions routing alogorithem

ELB(Elastice Load balancer)

in AWS it is called ELB


Features of ELB:
---------------

1>Spread the load
2>Single point of access
3>perofm the health checks and remove the failed nodes called high availability
4>Provide SSL for web servers
5> Enable session sticky ness: when one user requet served by server next time the same request wil be forwarded to the same serer to improvve the performanace



All the services come under VPC by deafault







Why ELS ??

Its a managed service, just create and use
 
ELB --> Target Group --> Backend servers

Need to add ip's to the target group
We can add multiple target groups
we can create superate SG for ELB and make backend servers SG can only take requests from that LB sg only



High availaility: LB can be created at least in two AZ's by default



3 types of LB are available:

1> Classic 2> Application (Http/Https) 3> Network (Tcp/Tls/Udp)

Application LB:
--------------
Best for container based and microservices applications

Network LB:
-----------

expensive, superast and servs only for ip based backend applications
serves million req per sec
