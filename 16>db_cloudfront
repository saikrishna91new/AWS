DB 2 types 
1> seuel (structured)
2>No sequel (Non structured)

Dynamo db is no sequel data base
server less
its also stored in tabler format only but not in sequencs and no perticuler keys to get data
Dynamo db is aws db and managed by AWS only
High available by default multipl AZ's
exremily fasr - single disit milly second max up to  9 sec
auto scaling: millions of scond per second
All we need is create a table for dynamo db which is very simple
How to create??
console - dynamo db - create - name - spicify one primery key like id or any thing which is relevant


No limits on table size, storage is unlimited
No Down time its always available


Use Cases:
----------


chnaging the table column is difficult in relation db
but we can easily add in non re;ational


dynamo db free tier:
25GB storage, 2.5 million read req/ 1gbdatatransfer out

charges :no of read, requests and write and also how much data you are storing

2 capacity planning 1> on demand (based on the load) unknown traffic 2> provisioned (in advance) known traffic


dynamo db:

each table has a primery key/ sort key
table can have many items rows
each row has no or atributes values



DAX (Dynamo db accelerator)
--------------------------
Its a caching service for dynamo db
Application looks into cache if need data, if cache is not available then loaded from amzon db
micro sec responce time
scale to millions of request for secons

Api: exposing  the app to public
provide acceess fron one app to anotr 
api should take predifined inputs and give the appropriate output

Api Gateway: to expose the api we use api gateway



while creating a table partionis mandatory and it wil be our maild id

read andwrite caapacity setting: ondemand/provisioned
ondemand : no need to give inputs
provisioned : need to give in the for of units

read capacity is 10 : 10 reads can happen parllely
write capacity is 10 : 10 write can happen parlley


by default the dynamoo data is encrypted no need to sppent amount


Cloud front:
-----------


CDN (content delivery network service)

there is a bucket to keep their data

usually in prime if one video got uploaded then all the users can access the same s3 bucket at a time to wathch in with out cdn
it causes more time bcz of band width

Amazon created edgelocation to avoid this
the object copied to ll edge locations


edge location is like data center with lot of processing power, storage

so if one indian access this vido the vido will be copied to the edge location wihihc is near to him
so user can access the video from there then response time increased a lot


cloud fron will come between you and s3 bucket and user
wil keep the conetent close to you by copying the data to edge location

not only movies any thing can be used with cloud front
it can get data from lb , ec2 andecs cluster thes are called origons fro cloud front
origin is from where cloud front get the data
not mandatory it will increase the responce time but very expensive


cloud fron wil check the data is availabe in cache or not intiatlly if not take the data from the origion and save it cache as well


can serve both dynamic and static content from different origin

cloud front come before lb and after route 53

user - route 53 - cloud front - lb of the closest region

makes your sute reliables sad scalable

create cloud front distributio - add s3 bucket asorigin - reming asdefault - create

cdn : netwrk of serers to provide faster content delivery
