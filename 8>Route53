There are prive domin sellers for seling the domain name 
it will take 24 hours to active out side 
in aws it will take few min if we buy with aws


Hosted zone: if we need to create or host a domain in  AWS we need to create one hosted zone
aws - route53 - hosted zone
hosted zone is used to configure the domain name
for 10 different donmins need 10 different hosted zones


We can route the domain name to the end application in 3 ways:


domain name --> directly to s3
domain name  --> lb --> ec2 instnaces
domain name --> ec2 instance

s3 will run only static application or html applications s3 can understand html
if you want access the app in s3 bucket then domain name is same as bucket name other wise we can't able to access



how to route the domain to s3 here 

goto hosted zone and create a record and here provide where to forard the request and also provide the alias name either ip or lb names 

How to configure Route 53 with the LB:

Create a record and select the alias name as application load ballancer and select the region
