protect data in transmission
encrypt and decrypt data by using a certificate
only the client and server whoo are exchanging the data can do this encryotion and secryption

If encryotion is not there some one can hace in between the network

Here client and server will encrypt and decrypt data with a KEY
Client will share the key with server, hacker can get the key but never open it bcz it again encrypted

there er 2 keys : 1> Public key 2> private key

Private key can't be shared it ill be with server, so no oter  decrypt

if any thing lock with publick key only private key will unlock it

client generate a random key and locked with public key and send to public key  and srver unlock it with private key

this is called asymetric

symetric:Same key for both encrypt and decrypt
Asymetric: Different keys fro encrypt and decrypt

AWS is ssl enabled

Certificate MAnager: allow yu to create a cert 

we can install ssl to LB

browser - LB -ssl
browser - server - non ssl

bcz once req is reached to lb then it will be in your AWS vpc

on onprem server to enable ssl - create csr - send it to CA - validate req and provide certs - copy it to server  and make configuration
need to keep monitering the certs as the cert has validty date if cert is expire nothing workk and difficult to moniter all the certs

in AWS certificate manager all are automaric like renewal of certs no need to manage them aws will manage
no need of csr and signed bcz aws it self a CA it will issue certs

How to enable ssl at LB:

Create a certificate:
go cert manager - request a public cert - give the domain name as route s3 - request - validte after creation

attach this to LB

go to LB --> Listener --> we can add or update the listener --> change the protocal to https --> port is 443  --> add the certificate to this domain 
select action --> select the target group too forward ... thats it.

betweenbrowser and lb is ssl and lb and server is no ssl that is enough for the security


Certtificate Manager:
----------------------

Allow you create, manage and deploy ssl certificate for use with in AWS
Integrated  with elb, cloud front, lb, api gateway so we can esily integrate
handleautomatic cert renewls




Secret Manager:
---------------
to store the passwords
no need to write down the password inside app foor db and all its not safe to put it in app
app will make a call to this secret manager and get the passwrd on the fly
if any password need to change secret manager will change the password for db and placethe updated one in secret manager from application looks for the password
benfitss:
make sure that password are rotated we mention this timing 
consle - secret manager - mutiple options for type of password -- select - secret name -- automatic rotation (selet time) can execute lamda function as well -- will
provide the code for the application to access secret management

1 secret - 40cents - halfrdoler per mnth

developer related stuff


KMS:
Key management service:
to provide security for the dat you are uploading to s3, ebs with the keys
will encrypt the data

key management - type (symetric/asemetric) -  region type single or multiple - name - select the thig who can use tis key(permission) - finish

we can't change the key configuration once it created 

asymetric will take time



test create a bucket and enable default encryption and s3 by defult has one key  here select a key 

data will be ebcryot at both rest ad transit as well


 kms has 2 encryption methods: 
 
 client side : user only enrypt and send it to s3
 server side : just give the data to server and server wil encrypt it and store
