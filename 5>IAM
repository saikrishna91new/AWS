Criteria to create IAM Authentication:
-------------------------------------
USERS --> Groups --> Policy --> Roles

Note: Policy to groups but roles don't assign to groups
Role: is a set of policy and providing access for Service

Roles adn policies are same as role is group of policies
IAM is  feature which is free in AWS
IAM provides shared access to theservices in AWS
IAM provides: MFA Multi factor authentication
IAM can fedearate with the existing LDAP so we can login with the existing users only

1> Create a user
2>Create a group
3>Add user to the group
4>Create a policy and assign it to group
5>Activate MFA for root

Root credentials should never be shared
Credentials won't be used in code
Root user only use for intial setup




AWS is responsible for only security of cloud but user has to responsible for security in cloud

We can have 2 types of access for users:
1> Console access (need account id to login to the console)
2>programatic access (for terraform cloud formation.. access key required)

Importnant poins:

One user can be part of multiple groups
2>group ppolicies applicatible to every user
3>Policy is nothing but a json file we can read it
4>policy can be assigned to user?? yes




Roles: 
Create a role first and select it while creating the serrvices like ec2. s3 ..et


If any services doesn't able to access any other services first trouble shooting point will start from IAM permissions
