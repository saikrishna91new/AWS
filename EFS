EFS(Elstic File System)

Its a shred drive
Its a managed service use like create and attach
Every one can access
Usufull for sharing and making every one access


Multiple ec2 instances can access same EFS its nothing like nfs mount points

can we use S3 as EFS??

S3 is a object store, if we need to update any doccument we have to download it and edit and re update it
in EFS its file system we can edit and u[date when ever we needed directly in file system

EFS: work with different AZ's

Its a fully managed service

Highly available,scalable and very expensive
Backup is automatic AWS can take care the backup and all
2 types of storage : ssd and hard disk (ssd is very fast and very high expensive)
EFS is a SSD tyle 
we have atleast one certification question in this topic
EFS can be used in onprem servers also
use security group to control access to EFS
Itss automatically scale up 
it has superate security groups for efs an ec2 for better secutiy perpose



How to create:

AWS --> Service --> Storage --> Create FS --> name --> Select AZ or Region


we can atthach this EFS at the ec2 instnce
the commadn is displayed in the attch section of EFS

in the ec2 SG allown NFS protical from this EFS 

in ec2 create directory annd aattach it to the EFS

Its a shared services if it si attaached in one machine and file is created in it then we can see the same file in all other attached instances 
for delete also same
