we can login in 3 ways
1? console
2 command line
3sdk



command line:

easy to install and support all services
super fast no need to navigate in command line lke in console
creation time is same in both command line and console but navigation tie is less in cmd  line
so fast when creating multiple resource

linke to create cli:"

wget https://awscli.amazonaws.com/


awss --version > to check the version



Configuration:
--------------

we need to provide user id and password
 command:: aws configure
provide acesskey id, pwd, region , output format (json/yaml/text)



>>aws s3 ls  to list all s3 buckets

aws srvie operation parameter
aws s3 help
aws ec2 describe instance



cnfigure credentials>> not with root account
console - iam - add users - name, select both  acess key and consolr - adin access - creat accexx key 
aws s3 delete
asw s3 remove
aws s3 cp <image_path> bucket name



aws s3 sync command refferance
aws s3 sync. <bucketname>	> to snc all images in the current directory


Cloud formation:
----------------

Infrastructure as a code solution from the AWS
we can give all the resources in the template 

eg if we need the infra today and not for tomorw and needed again after two days back the will go throw cloud formation will take less time other wise through cosnole 
it will take more time to do all these provisioning

we can write what infra we want in one file 
declerative: we just tell what to create not how to create




terminology:

Template, stack, Change set

templateL: where you define your instance 
stack : when we need to create it wil create a stack in s3

we can place it in git hub
folow the order exactly in the template file
if nay thing fails it will delete the entire set up



cloud formation - stact- template is readey - upload a file - create stack
we need to update template s3 manully from there aws wil take it

in stack demoo templates in s3 
whicle cretaing  the template will ask for db name, useid, password ..etc

if we remove the stack all the resources it has created also deleted

beter not to go for stack when creating tthe shared resources
