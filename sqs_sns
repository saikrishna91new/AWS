Synchronus communication:

if there are 2 applications want to communicate a put the message at som where and b look at the message adn process it and put a msg and a will take it and put it to user,, this is
happeniing in railways and all this is asynchronus communication

what is asynchronus ans synhronus comunication??


SQS:

Simple Que service
Applicatio to Application service

Synchronus communication: app a directly send the message to app b then if load increase b will crash

so to avoide this ques is came inot pictures

a put a msg in ques and b application connectl to the que and read the mesg and take the approriiate action and put it back to the que this is asynchronus communication
ques can handle large number of requests 

we can enable auto scaling as per the ques then if msg number increased in the que then no of instances are automcatically created
autoscaling rule is que length
SQS is used by user deployed apps and aws serices as well for thecomunication 

Its fully managed like just provison and use it
No limit for the messages in the que
Low latency milli sec processing time
Possible to horizontal scaling auto scaling enabled
Prodcuer who is going to put the message consumer who is going to consume the message
Horizontal scaling in terms of consumer is based on the number of messages in the ques new instnaces created


ex: 
a mobile to upload pics and stored in the s3 bucket

Creating a que: create a que provide name rest all defaults and save

for access policy we can specify the iam user who can access this

End points: wher to cnnect the que and read the message
application team is use to connect to the que to read the messages
we have option to test the ques (send and receive message)

endpoints continuously cheking the ques for messages to take it 


how to confgure s3 to send message??
got to s3 and event notifications 
select the scenarios
event: send the message to SQS que
here it will throw permission error like "before s3 can publis messages s3 shoukd ave permissions"
we have to specify the permission to s3 to put the messages in que and talk with the ques
how?

go to que -- access plicy -- provide te permissions

the message contains the event soruce (s3) what time it is, what is the event name object created and complte info of s3 object

>> we can attach a service to this que which can receive this message and process it

limitation on essage??
while creating a que we could seet the max size is 256 kb
if needed for the large we need to split and send and the destination need to assemble it



2 types of ques:
1> Standerd
Order is not gurante not expensive
2>FIFO (first in first out)
Msgs deliverd in the order they received bit expensive


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<SNS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
Simple notification service
SQS can used btwn a and b like point to pint

how a want to talk with b, c, d at a  time??
here sns is used 
Also called as topic, its a topic service by aws
topic is if you put a messages the all the subscribers can get a copy of that message


Create topic - name - remining as default and create
