Synchronus communication:

if there are 2 applications want to communicate a put the message at som where and b look at the message adn process it and put a msg and a will take it and put it to user,, this is
happeniing in railways and all this is asynchronus communication

what is asynchronus ans synhronus comunication??


SQS:

Simple Que service
Applicatio to Application service

Synchronus communication: app a directly send the message to app b then if load increase b will crash

so to avoide this ques is came inot pictures

a put a msg in ques and b application connectl to the que and read the mesg and take the approriiate action and put it back to the que this is asynchronus communication
ques can handle large number of requests 

we can enable auto scaling as per the ques then if msg number increased in the que then no of instances are automcatically created
autoscaling rule is que length
SQS is used by user deployed apps and aws serices as well for thecomunication 

Its fully managed like just provison and use it
No limit for the messages in the que
Low latency milli sec processing time
Possible to horizontal scaling auto scaling enabled
Prodcuer who is going to put the message consumer who is going to consume the message
Horizontal scaling in terms of consumer is based on the number of messages in the ques new instnaces created


ex: 
a mobile to upload pics and stored in the s3 bucket

Creating a que: create a que provide name rest all defaults and save

for access policy we can specify the iam user who can access this

End points: wher to cnnect the que and read the message
application team is use to connect to the que to read the messages
we have option to test the ques (send and receive message)

endpoints continuously cheking the ques for messages to take it 


how to confgure s3 to send message??
got to s3 and event notifications 
select the scenarios
event: send the message to SQS que
here it will throw permission error like "before s3 can publis messages s3 shoukd ave permissions"
we have to specify the permission to s3 to put the messages in que and talk with the ques
how?

go to que -- access plicy -- provide te permissions

the message contains the event soruce (s3) what time it is, what is the event name object created and complte info of s3 object

>> we can attach a service to this que which can receive this message and process it

limitation on essage??
while creating a que we could seet the max size is 256 kb
if needed for the large we need to split and send and the destination need to assemble it



2 types of ques:
1> Standerd
Order is not gurante not expensive
2>FIFO (first in first out)
Msgs deliverd in the order they received bit expensive


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<SNS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
Simple notification service
SQS can used btwn a and b like point to pint

how a want to talk with b, c, d at a  time??
here sns is used 
Also called as topic, its a topic service by aws
topic is if you put a messages the all the subscribers can get a copy of that message


Create topic - name - remining as default and create

topic name extention is mandatory as .c4 

Note: target c4 is only destination is ques
From topic we can send a message to que also 


What happens when you orde with amazon?/
we added few item to cart and check out what is happening in the backend??
it will check wether the items are available
we get the payment confirmation and order notificationa and shipping notification all these things we will ge in parllel
there are 3 different srrvice like pay ment, notification, shipping services which are happen in parleel how it is happening?? 
this wil put a message in topic and that topic isassosiated to all the three services


if we select standers topic support for subcriptions, subscription is who is going to take the message
create topic
goto subscriptsns add subscription
we can also give our email id whichwe can get the mesage and need to confirm 
go to subscrition and publish a message to test 

there are multiple types of subscriptions like ques/mail ..etc
we can provide multiple subscritionsat a time like que and mail same time
we  can execut the lambda function
Lamda is the function who is prcoessing the images, down time, thumbnail, format of image its some logic or soe code from aws which is server less
Lamda is like ecs but not suitable for heavy use its time is only for 5 to 15 mns
its very lite and small code runners
its like a cotainer services
its a aws servcei it wil take code from user and run it in container


we can sedn the sending event type as https/text/https ..etc in subscriptn
we can also attach the mobile number as well


SNS- tosend notification to multiple receivers
Its managed serice
charges are based on the number of msgs that processed
1 billion messages are free
it is called pub/sub model
publisher/subscribe model

publisher to topic and subscriber receive

use case: client -- s3 -- amazon sns -- aws lambda

Thumb nail??
Lambda function will creat the thumbnail for the events


SNS also used for alerts and alarms
-----------------------------------
when alarm get intiated out that message in sns and subscriber can kick the auto scaling group and may be anothe lmabda function to restart and
another lambda functin to send mail like this


Use case3: Alarm to create ticket with service now




SQS: one to one
SNS: one to many

most of the time they used together 
all depedns on the application requirements




In Que acknoledgement is definatly expectable provides ordering, guarantee deliery
in topic we don't have acknoledgement provides ordering not gurante delivery

in sqs consmer will continuously pools the que and if any thing find it will take the message and process it and delte that if the message was not processed
we can define the time till how much time the message retain in the ques
if the consumer if down for some time and other cosnukmer came up then it will take that message we won't loose the message
