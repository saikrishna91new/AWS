Its a monitering service by AWS
by default AWS monitering will be enabled 
we can enable for different metrics
will help to create alerts and alarms
can create dashboard for graphical display
basic monitering will trigger for every 5 minute we can reduce this time line but its chargable, we can enabl this for critical services
we can moniter the application logs for specific error and create alarms

Cloud watch metrics:
-------------------
1>Memorey utilisation
2>No of request
3>Response time
4>Coonections for db

Cloud watch concepts:
-----------------------
Cloud watch dashboards
Cloudwathc alarm
Cloudwatch logs
Cloudwatch metrics
Cloudwatch events
cludwathc application monitering   (new addition)
cloudwatch insight




secanrio:

if one app used to upload images from the mobile, then we have one lamda function to resize it how to do that??
when ever we upload the image one event trriggers , we can process a lmbda function with the help of that event. and resize the image
this is goint to be automatic


while using the aws we don't need any other monitering tools as there is one default 

insights allows us to write quiries to get the data we want

in mircro service architechure large application is devided into small applications so every request need to pass through many application to complete
every service run in its own continer
if there is a problem its very difficult to find out where it fails?? so we go with application monitering
it should tell where your request is going how many micro services its passing and which miicro service taking how much time and which failed and why it failed




Dashboards:
Gives you simple view of your applicaton doing this moment like failure, responce time, cpu  ...etc

Creating the dash board:
-----------------------

create dashboard : name : create
aws cloud watch - dashboard - create dashboard
Name:
Configure:
selet cpu and ec2
we could see all the ec2 instanses we have created still now
like this add widgets to your dashboard



we can select cpu, lb resource, error messages 404,500 etc
we can go back to year as well to see the metrics to track the issues
dash board is global region can monitoracross all the regions

first dash board is free after $3 for 3 dash boards


we can create alarm for any activites like if cpu is 50% create alarm and requests are > 500 create alarm .. etc

based upon these alerts we can asign tasks for the ASG group like ec2 restarts and all

how to create an alarm??

Cloud formation - create alarm -- select metric - give avg value metri - action to take (optional)


Cloud watch logs:
------------------

Monitering ypur application logs
in real ev logs should be moniterrd for application logs
Continuously moniter the logs and trigger an alert if it find anything

store,monitor and access log files from ec2, Rote53, Lamda, ECS, beanstalk...,etc


by deafault AWS can not write the logs to cloud watch

remining serverices are automatically send to cloud watch

inalarm state wil display if alarm triggered 


Log group:
---------

By default log group will be created for every service and we could see the logs inside it
it should be in xml format
we can find it in cloud watch/logs/


How to moniter the logs in log groups??

select the essage string and tell that when ever we get that msg alarm should be created

log group -> metric filter - create metric filter -> give string to search, give name -> create metric

After creating the metric create an alarm and provide threshold, configure email, alarm name >> for logs
