Lambda is a server less service
Its a comppute service like ec2 d/f ec2 and mada is its server less no need to provide infra just give the code to lamda
its like ELB but in ELB  also need to provison ec2 service
Lamda is cotainerised, run the code in container
we can see nothing like contianers, servers in lambda
Limit on lamda: if your app is run more than 15 mins or more than 2 gb then lamda is not an option


EC2                 -                                                       lamda
Virtual servers                                                 Virtual functions
scaling means adding servers                                    Compltly automated based on the load 

Lamda designed to run simple and short application and its event based
event is any action like uplodaing image, send a message like it should be a action
Lamda funtion wont run all the time only run when there is an event and after the execution it will exit, unkie ec2 which run always

Serverless services : db, storage, sqs, sns ..etc which called managed services no need to prive any infra
ec2 is user managed services we need to provison the infra for servers

Lamda charges as millisec for the run time

eg: if high cpu is ther we need to restart the ec2 by lmda, but lamda won't moniter the ec2 how it restat??? aws moniter and create alarm and target for alarn is lamda
function here

AWS monitering -> alarm - target - lamda


free for i million request and 3.2 million sec of compute training

lamda can get event from every service on AWS available
max  available mem is 3 gb for lada
max time 25 mns
zipped: 50mb, unzipped 250mb console 3 mb
temorary memory : 512 mb

lamda function scale upto 1000 container for request 
use cases:
1> serverless log  monitering: for any app if we need to moniter the hung thread then create a event alarm and target is lamda if that alert triggerd , it avoide
the contiinuous monitering

2>Server less jobs: eg: if in amazon acnt sagrigate theusers about to expire their subscription and send them notifications these type of jobs or clearing the cache

3> Serverless website: compute, content/app , db, entry point, security services(cognito) all are server less

4>Image and vido processing: to conert the images uploading in s3 and eg a vido quality will be changd in mobile, laptop and tv basedon the item we are using this can be done 
by lamda also clled creating thumb nails:: like changes the vidoes and images as per the format

5> Automated backups: if we need to take backup like dbs based on the utilizations or speified time

6> File confertion: if one app only takes json then convert the xml to json

7> Log analytics/ security alerts

8> Processing s3 objects



Types of Lamda functions:
------------------------
1> Blue print (predefined functions)
2> Own code
3> Container
4>applications predefined

select blue print
select python
Role would be created automatically
create function
and upload the python code here either in the zip file or s3 bucket ur

update an alrm for this lmbda to rigger
*****there is a test option here to test the lamd function********

its is logic and lamda execute that logic,its devolerps teamaction

How to assosiate the event:

go to lamda -- add trigger 
select service where t trigger
select s3 
select the bucket
 (we can add this from the resource as welllike s3, lb and ..etc)
select the event type
add

go to moniter to check when it is executed, we can see the execution time, allocated memorey , used memory .. etc
we can test as well and ceck the outut timeing and memory
it should be crerate a log group in the cloud watch


destination in lmda function:

What need to be done after the execution of lamda , like sending mail , sending to a que or send it to a othe lamda function
the mail notification of lamda shuld be in json format with all the details



API Gateway: Service by AWS like lb for lamda functiond and microo services,, it is a entry point for microservices
What is API??

Help you quickly get a uri to acces the lamda function,,like in a minute we can give access,, so one lmda can be accessesible from othe function

create api - region - lamda name  -name -next till create
will get an url to access the lamda function which can use to access this service
