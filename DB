In Data base section we can read about two types of data bases 
1> Relation DB
2> Non Relational DB



Relational DB                                            |                                 Non-Relational DB
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1> SQL DB                                                                                  1> Non-SQL DB
2>Data stored in tables                                                                    2> No concept of tables
3>Not designed for scaling (Horizontal)                                                    3> Designed for scaling verticle
4>Fixed data model                                                                         4> Relaxed
5>Slow responce time                                                                       5> Fast responce time
6>Caching is expensive                                                                     6> In Memory cacthig
7>Oracle, SQL, MySql,ProstageSQL,MariaDB,Amazon Aurora                                     7> Mango DB,cassandra, redis, Amazon Dynamo DB, Apache Hbase

Amazon Auroa is most used DB in AWS its very less expensive

How to create? 
AWS --> DB --> Create DB --> Select type 

Its a managed service
while creating the machine it is ask for machine type( free type, db sepcific)

DB price charges depends on
---------------------------

1> Running time
2> Storage
3> No of requestss
4>Backup
5>Data Transfer




We can't login to the instance created by the DB
Backups are automatically taken for production for dtq and test we can give it as a option
Storage automatically increase if request increase


Life cycle is same as s3 it depends on the no of laste used days
only one dns for the entire db


Read replica:
AWS create a copy of DB for read perpose which increase the performance
for wrote reqiest will go to the primary one
read replica can create in same az or different region
there will be some millim sec delay between primary one and read replica
Update will be happen in milisec 
Multiple rea replicas we can set in auroar max is 15 and remining are 5
Generally used for reports
No capacity planning required bcz its automatic 



Aurora propriate with mysql and sql and prostage
its bit expensive
5 time better than mysql and 3 times better than prostage


Storage types: ssd, iops, Magnetic tapes


Backup timings we can define like daily at 12 am like this
upgrade time wil be 30 mins like that
750 hrs free for 3 db instances

end point and port will be displayed while selecting the DB we can coonect it through any cliesnt

public acess needed for DB to connect with the clienst
