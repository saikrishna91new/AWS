7>run a nginx container and acccess via url
8>willl never access app through docker container in real time 



same like docker hub in AWS we can store images at ECR ( Elastic container registry)
docker hub is public and ECR is privete owr own 
in real time use ecr instead of dcoker
its completly managed servces
cntiner service will download images from here
just create a image and upload it in ecr 
it uses s3 only in the backend to store the images, it is taken care by aws
our task is just create a repo and update it
ECS/EKS (elastice container service/ Elastic kubernetes servvice) these two are the rochestration tools
to manage multiple containers which is manged by AWS
ecs - is completly owned by AWS
eks - is not completly owned by aws , kubernetees is googlle's

why eks?? if already existing application in kubernetes can move to AWS

eks: just need to bring the configuration files and make the env ready no need to build the cluster of kubernetes
